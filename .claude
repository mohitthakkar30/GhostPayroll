# Ghost Payroll - Project Context

## Project Overview

**Ghost Payroll** is a privacy-preserving payroll system built on Solana for the **Solana Privacy Hack Hackathon** (Jan 12-30, 2026, submissions due Feb 1, 2026).

### Core Value Proposition
- Companies can pay employees with **hidden salary amounts** on-chain
- Uses **ZK proofs** and **MPC encryption** for privacy
- Payments are **verifiable** without revealing actual amounts
- Employees can **cash out** to virtual cards via Starpay

### Target Bounties (Total: $33.5k+)
- **Arcium** ($10k) - MPC encryption for salary data
- **ShadowWire/Radr** ($15k) - Private transfers using Bulletproofs
- **Helius** ($5k) - RPC and webhook monitoring
- **Starpay** ($3.5k) - Crypto to virtual card cash-out

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Smart Contracts | Anchor 0.30.1 (Solana) |
| Private Transfers | ShadowWire (@radr/shadowwire) - Bulletproofs ZK |
| Encryption | Arcium MPC (Multi-Party Computation) |
| Monitoring | Helius Webhooks + RPC |
| Cash-out | Starpay API (virtual Mastercard) |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Wallet | Solana Wallet Adapter |

### Privacy Flow
1. **Company** encrypts salary data using Arcium MPC before storing on-chain
2. **Payment** is executed via ShadowWire's private transfer (amount hidden using Bulletproofs)
3. **Proof** is recorded on-chain (proves payment happened without revealing amount)
4. **Employee** can verify payment and optionally cash out to Starpay virtual card

## Smart Contract Design

### Account Structures

#### Company Account
```rust
pub struct Company {
    pub authority: Pubkey,           // Company admin wallet
    pub name: String,                // Company name (max 50 chars)
    pub employee_count: u16,         // Active employee count
    pub budget_commitment: [u8; 32], // Hash commitment of budget (not actual amount)
    pub payment_token: Pubkey,       // USDC mint address
    pub payment_frequency: PaymentFrequency, // Weekly/Biweekly/Monthly
    pub last_payment_timestamp: i64, // Unix timestamp
    pub next_payment_due: i64,       // Unix timestamp
    pub total_payments_made: u64,    // Counter
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

#### Employee Account
```rust
pub struct Employee {
    pub wallet: Pubkey,              // Employee's wallet address
    pub company: Pubkey,             // Associated company PDA
    pub encrypted_salary: Vec<u8>,   // Arcium-encrypted salary (max 256 bytes)
    pub salary_commitment: [u8; 32], // Hash for verification
    pub payment_frequency: PaymentFrequency,
    pub join_date: i64,
    pub last_payment_date: i64,
    pub total_payments_received: u64,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

#### PaymentProof Account
```rust
pub struct PaymentProof {
    pub payment_id: u64,
    pub employee: Pubkey,
    pub company: Pubkey,
    pub payment_date: i64,
    pub amount_commitment: [u8; 32], // Hash of amount (not actual amount)
    pub zk_proof: Vec<u8>,           // Bulletproof or ZK proof (max 512 bytes)
    pub shadowwire_tx_signature: String, // ShadowWire transaction ID
    pub status: PaymentStatus,       // Pending/Processing/Completed/Failed
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

### Instructions
1. `initialize_company` - Create company with treasury PDA
2. `add_employee` - Add employee with encrypted salary
3. `update_employee_salary` - Update encrypted salary
4. `remove_employee` - Soft delete (deactivate) employee
5. `process_payment` - Execute payment from treasury to employee
6. `record_payment_proof` - Store ShadowWire proof on-chain

### PDA Seeds
- Company: `["company", authority.key()]`
- Employee: `["employee", company.key(), employee_wallet]`
- Treasury: `["treasury", company.key()]`
- PaymentProof: `["payment_proof", company.key(), employee_wallet, payment_id]`

## External Integrations

### ShadowWire (Private Payments)
- **Purpose**: Hide payment amounts using Bulletproofs (ZK proofs)
- **Package**: `@radr/shadowwire`
- **Transfer Types**:
  - Internal: Amount completely hidden (both parties use ShadowWire)
  - External: Sender anonymous, amount visible
- **Fee**: 1% relayer fee
- **Supported Tokens**: SOL, USDC, BONK, RADR, and more

### Arcium (MPC Encryption)
- **Purpose**: Encrypt salary data so only company + employee can decrypt
- **Approach**: Multi-Party Computation - process encrypted data without decrypting
- **Integration**: Mark sensitive data as "confidential" in Arcis (Rust extension)

### Helius (Monitoring)
- **Purpose**: Real-time payment tracking and notifications
- **Features**: Webhooks, RPC, transaction indexing
- **Use Case**: Notify employee when payment is complete

### Starpay (Cash-out)
- **Purpose**: Convert crypto to virtual Mastercard
- **Features**: No KYC, Apple/Google Pay integration
- **Fees**: 0.2% activation, 2.5% top-up
